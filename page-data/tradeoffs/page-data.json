Ethereum was the second largest cryptocurrency, behind Bitcoin. It was the first alternative to Bitcoin to come up, and people held it in high regard. The idea of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, i.e. an organization run in a decentralized way without any central authority, had been around for a few years, lauded by many as a valuable Blockchain use case.

Figures ranging from Vlad Zamfir, a well-known contributor to the Ethereum environment, to Emin G\\xFCn Sirer, a well-known academic researcher focusing on Blockchain, identified these bugs and raised the alarm. Nearly a month later, however, the vulnerabilities had not yet been fixed, and the DAO was exploited to steal roughly $50m USD from the decentralized application running it. This ultimately led to a significant drop in the price of Ether (~35%). The only solution the Ethereum community had was to create a fork undoing the hack, which ended up splitting Ethereum into Ethereum and Ethereum Classic (Ethereum Classic is still worth roughly $700m USD as of July 2020, even while it has suffered from 51% attacks and other exploits due to being largely unimproved since branching off from the main Ethereum community).
