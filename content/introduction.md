*DELETE BELOW, JUST TO PROVIDE OUTLINE FOR THIS INTRO*
It is important to impart on students the importance of why content is truly useful to learn (Mackness et al., 2013). This introduction will highlight the value in learning about the more technical aspects of Blockchain. Additionally, the course will show students what to expect from the course, and outline some introductory material that is prerequisite for many of the topics covered in the course, such as “Blockchain 101” topics: Hash Puzzles, BTC, ETH, Smart Contracts. However, this introduction will also emphasize the importance of weighing Pros & Cons within Blockchain solutions, and determining whether or not Blockchain is truly the appropriate solution for a given situation.

# Introduction from James & Rishub
We created this course because we saw a gap between the innovation in the Blockchain industry and the existing educational resources about Blockchain. In this introduction, we outline some of the topics that we find to be particularly important for someone that is interested in Blockchain to understand. These topics do not comprehensively cover the innovations in the industry, but they give a strong overview of the types of topics that exist in Blockchain beyond the topics that are traditionally covered in media and educational content about Blockchain. This selection of topics are intended provide a productive, technical, academic, and research-based foundation in Blockchain that will allow the everyday Blockchain enthusiast to adequately evaluate and analyze new technologies and projects within the Blockchain industry.

## Intro to Blockchain
Blockchain is a fairly recent technological innovation. Blockchain at its core is a combination of a data structure and a networking protocol: it was invented in 2008 in the “bitcoin” paper by the pseudonymous author “Satoshi Nakamoto” (Nakamoto, 2008).

Blockchain essentially works by maintaining an ever-expanding linked list that is cryptographically verified to only allow for additional data elements, “blocks”, to be added to the tail-end of the data structure under certain conditions.

In the original Bitcoin, these conditions were to  use a consensus protocol which dictated that each member of the network agreed to use the longest network with a valid cryptographic history, and to allow the first member to solve a cryptographic puzzle to add one block.

This system for adding on new blocks is commonly referred to as a “proof of work” system, in which users “mine” for new blocks. This data structure has primarily been used to create a reliable, limited supply of digital currencies known as “Cryptocurrency”.

In 2014, a secondary use for Blockchain was created in the “Ethereum” white paper, which outlined a way to support a robust scripting language on top of a Blockchain network (Buterin, 2014).

There is a substantial academic history to the “bitcoin” paper: it is built on top of numerous other papers ranging from a 1991 Blockchain which lacked a detailed consensus protocol and proof of work mechanism, to the cryptographic idea of “Merkle trees” (a cryptographic method to combine cryptographic signatures), to the 2005 “Bit gold” paper by Nick Szabo which included many of the same features as the Satoshi paper (Szabo, 2005).

### The Value of Learning Blockchain

The disruptive nature of Blockchain, and its potential is highlighted by the state of the industry. As of May 30th, 2020, the Market Cap of all Cryptocurrency was roughly $280 billion USD (Cryptomarketcap.com). For example, one Blockchain use case that has been widely adopted is online gambling: the current size of the market is ~$4.5 billion USD (Redman, 2017). This is a large, and quickly growing industry; the Cryptocurrency gambling market is growing at roughly 9% annually (Fenech, 2019).

Quickly growing industries typically offer large numbers of opportunities, and Blockchain is no different: many studies estimate that there are roughly 10 jobs in Blockchain for every qualified candidate (Lindquist, 2020).

#### Critical Topics for Innovation and Research Within Blockchain

Many see blockchain as synonymous with cryptocurrency, yet, with its core attributes including security, confidentiality, and integrity, we can create large amounts of data which can be used in social smart contracts leveraging consensus (Giungato 2017). In general, there are so many more uses of blockchain, and smart contracts are one way we can take full advantage of it to improve our society.

Additionally, it can be used to create agreements between buyers and sellers. This can transform the world of online marketplaces, and create trust through the use of a public ledger (Kosowatz 2019). The impact is really unbound because of how many different fields and areas of economics blockchain can truly affect.

Blockchain innovations beyond the well-known use-cases of Cryptocurrency and Decentralized Applications include:
1. alternative mechanisms for Blockchain scalability including Sidechains,
2. private Blockchain networks, and Leader Election;
3. alternative mechanisms for trust including encrypted Smart Contracts;
4. mechanisms for getting real world data onto a Blockchain (referred to as “Oracles”);
5. mechanisms for increased security and regulatory compliance including private Blockchains;
6. mechanisms for healthy network participation such as varied incentives and punishments, related to game theory;
7. decentralized Cryptocurrency exchanges run by Smart Contracts;
8. decentralized autonomous organizations that are capable of running large-scale projects, including hiring and paying employees;
9. systems allowing users to make payments using Cryptocurrency for traditional payment systems;
10. tokenization of real world assets, including but not limited to “Stablecoins” linked to real world currency (Poon & Dryja, 2016; Pongnumkul et al., 2017; Eyal et al., 2016; Zyskind et al., 2016; Adler et al., 2018; Nakamoto, 2008; Banach, 2019; Warren & Bandeali, 2017; Norta et al., 2015; del Castillo, 2020; Gan, 2019).

<note: I published some of this in a Medium article already, and have slightly better formatting. Will fix formatting of this list later to be a bit more readable. HOWEVER, on this note, could we also get a separate specially formatted box at end for references? something that makes it stand out a bit less so that we can include it without making the page look too long. alternatively, we could make separate pages for each page, that include the references for that page, and link it at the bottom of the page. or do an expandable tool-tip type thing.>

Additionally, there have been many Blockchain innovations creating alternative mechanisms for network governance (e.g. who updates and maintains the network) including co-op models such as RChain, board/mixed models such as Ethereum, BDFL models such as Python, full decentralization such as Bitcoin, on-chain/Proof of Stake voting such as Tezos, and private models such as Ripple/Libra (RChain Coop, 2017; Mann, 2019; Van Rossum, 2007; De Filippi & Loveluck, 2016; Goodman, 2014; Schwartz et al., 2014; Amaden et al., 2019).
