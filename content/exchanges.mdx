# Non-Exchange Platforms for Exchanging Cryptocurrency
In the early days of Cryptocurrency, the primary method that people had to buy and sell Cryptocurrency was to find someone willing to make an in-kind or cash transaction on some type of platform made for that purpose. Few centralized Cryptocurrency exchanges existed, and those that did largely failed to legally serve the US market; decentralized exchanges were not possible as smart contracts were not really commonplace until Ethereum came out a few years later. These platforms that came up included websites such as Reddit, where users could garner a reputation for being a trustworthy counterparty for exchanging Cryptocurrency, and easily make posts to find such counterparties. There were issues with this: scamming was rampant, and some individuals even attempted to perform these trades over Craigslist or similar general purpose marketplaces, which had no reliable reputation system.

# Legal Challenges: Regulation and Compliance Without Guidelines
Regulation is a constant problem for Cryptocurrency exchanges. Rules are interpreted in numerous ways with often limited legal definitions around how to classify Cryptocurrency. In the United States, the SEC does not have clear guidelines for trading Cryptocurrency. To-date, the SEC has often indicated that they will treat Cryptocurrencies as securities, based on their rulings around “Initial Coin Offering” fundraising; exchanges are therefore at a similar risk of unexpected regulatory and compliance complications.

<Resources title="Suggested Reading" text="In an article for Drexel Law Review, O’Connor argues that future regulation could be determined on whether or not the seller of a Cryptocurrency makes promises about the token: promises of “future development or price appreciation”, similar to how ICOs operate, could result in Cryptocurrencies being considered securities. The flip side to this, for Cryptocurrencies that are promised as-is (no explicit, centralized improvement plan) to function primarily as digital currencies (e.g. Bitcoin), O’Connor suggests that they are less likely to be classified as securities." resources={[ {link: "https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/drexel11&div=15&id=&page=", text: "Overreaching its Mandate, Michael O’Connor.

The DAO token brought about the first significant action by the SEC on Cryptocurrency, and they classified as securities and the SEC ruled that exchanges trading them were not abiding by securities regulation. Damages and fines were not pursued, but this introduces possible issues of supporting certain Cryptocurrencies. The ruling abstracted out possible regulation to include Cryptocurrencies that promise future development - which is many of them (and practically every ICO Cryptocurrency). O'Connor notes that most Cryptocurrencies do not actually include any "investment contract" functionality, which should put them outside the purview of SEC authority. Ultimately, however, there is immense regulatory risk for Cryptocurrency exchanges, because there are not enough solidified, codified policies for how to classify and regulate Cryptocurrency.

Lastly, we are left with a significant question: Do modern security regulations offer a feasible model for an asset distributed globally, amongst millions of stakeholders? If so, how would we define many traditional terms within existing regulation; O'Connor highlights the question of how to define “agents”, traditionally actors of a certain company or members listed on traditional assets. Would this term include open source developers? Forks? Overall, a poor definition could result in liability to Cryptocurrency exchanges just from people engaging with the Blockchain network which is typically, by definition, open.
