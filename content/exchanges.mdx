# Opening Quote
<Resources title="Quote" text="Cryptocurrencies, based on and led by Bitcoin, have shown promise as infrastructure for pseudonymous on-line payments, cheap remittance, trustless digital as-set exchange, and smart contracts.  However, Bitcoin-derived blockchain protocols have inherent scalability limits that trade off between throughput and latency, which withhold the realization of this potential." resources={[ {text: "“Bitcoin-NG”, presented at 13th USENIX Symposium, Eyal et al.

# Non-Exchange Platforms for Exchanging Cryptocurrency
In the early days of Cryptocurrency, the primary method that people had to buy and sell Cryptocurrency was to find someone willing to make an in-kind or cash transaction on some type of platform made for that purpose. Few centralized Cryptocurrency exchanges existed, and those that did largely failed to legally serve the US market; decentralized exchanges were not possible as smart contracts were not really commonplace until Ethereum came out a few years later. These platforms that came up included websites such as Reddit, where users could garner a reputation for being a trustworthy counterparty for exchanging Cryptocurrency, and easily make posts to find such counterparties. There were issues with this: scamming was rampant, and some individuals even attempted to perform these trades over Craigslist or similar general purpose marketplaces, which had no reliable reputation system.
